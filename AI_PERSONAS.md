# AI Personas Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of distinct AI personas with unique personalities and dynamic conversations. Each AI assistant has been given a specific personality, conversation style, and specialty, making the chat experience more engaging and personalized.

## Key Components

### 1. Personas Composable
The `usePersonas.js` composable provides a central management system for AI personas:
- Defines unique personality traits for each AI assistant
- Manages conversation history per assistant
- Generates persona-specific responses
- Handles message management for each persona

```javascript
// Example persona definition
{
  id: 2,
  name: 'Claude 3.7',
  avatar: 'https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=2',
  isOnline: true,
  personality: 'Thoughtful, nuanced, and balanced',
  specialty: 'General knowledge and reasoning',
  greeting: 'Hello! I\'m Claude 3.7, Anthropic\'s most capable AI assistant...',
  conversationStyle: 'Detailed and comprehensive',
  messages: [],
  lastMessage: {
    content: 'It\'s a web application with a modern chat interface.',
    timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 1200000),
  }
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Conversation Management
When a user switches between different AI assistants:
- The chat window updates to show the conversation history with that specific assistant
- Each assistant maintains its own message history
- New assistants start with a personalized greeting message
- User messages and responses are stored per assistant

### 3. Persona-Specific Responses
Each AI assistant responds in a unique style based on its personality:
- Claude 3.7: Thoughtful and balanced responses
- Claude 3 Opus: Intellectual and analytical
- Claude 3 Sonnet: Practical and efficient
- Claude 3 Haiku: Concise and direct
- GPT-4: Creative and technical
- GPT-3.5: Helpful and straightforward
- Gemini Pro: Data-driven and analytical
- Llama 3: Community-focused and open

## Implementation Details

### Personality-Based Response Generation
The system generates responses based on each assistant's personality:

```javascript
// Generate a response based on persona's personality
const generatePersonaResponse = (personaId, userMessage) => {
  const persona = getPersonaById(personaId);
  if (!persona) return null;
  
  // Create a response message with content based on persona's personality
  let responseContent = '';
  
  switch (persona.name) {
    case 'Claude 3.7':
      responseContent = `I've considered your message carefully. ${getThoughtfulResponse(userMessage)}`;
      break;
    case 'Claude 3 Opus':
      responseContent = `From an analytical perspective, ${getAnalyticalResponse(userMessage)}`;
      break;
    // Other personas...
  }
  
  return {
    id: persona.messages.length + 2,
    content: responseContent,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    senderId: persona.id,
    status: 'delivered'
  };
};
```

### Conversation Initialization
Each persona starts with a personalized greeting:

```javascript
// Initialize conversations for each persona
const initializeConversations = () => {
  personas.forEach(persona => {
    // Only initialize if no messages exist yet
    if (persona.messages.length === 0) {
      // Create initial greeting message from the AI
      persona.messages = [
        {
          id: 1,
          content: persona.greeting,
          timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 60000),
          senderId: persona.id,
          status: 'read'
        }
      ];
    }
  });
};
```

### UI Enhancements
The UI has been enhanced to display persona-specific information:
- Personality traits shown in the chat header
- Specialties displayed in the contacts list
- Conversation style reflected in message formatting

## User Experience
The enhanced personas create a more engaging and realistic chat experience:
1. Each AI assistant feels distinct and unique
2. Conversations are contextual and continuous
3. Switching between assistants provides variety
4. Users can choose assistants based on their needs or preferences

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include:
1. More sophisticated personality modeling
2. Persona-specific UI themes
3. Ability to customize or create new personas
4. Improved context awareness between personas
5. More varied response styles and conversation paths
