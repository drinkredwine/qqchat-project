# Agent Workflow Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the agent workflow system to create more coherent and comprehensive answers by properly chaining LLM responses between steps.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Cumulative Context Building
The system now builds a cumulative context as it progresses through workflow steps:
- Each step receives the results of all previous steps
- This allows each step to build upon the work done in previous steps
- Avoids repetition of information across steps
- Creates a more coherent flow of reasoning

### 2. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
Prompts have been improved throughout the workflow:
- Execution step prompts now explicitly instruct the LLM to build upon previous results
- The summary prompt has been enhanced to focus on generating a coherent final answer
- Clear instructions prevent meta-commentary in the final output
- Formatting guidance ensures well-structured responses

### 3. Meta-Commentary Removal
A new `cleanFinalSummary` function removes common meta-commentary phrases:
- Strips phrases like "Based on my analysis..." from the beginning of summaries
- Removes concluding phrases like "In conclusion..." from the end
- Results in cleaner, more direct answers
- Preserves the actual content and insights

### 4. Improved Fallback Handling
Fallback mechanisms have been enhanced:
- More coherent fallback summaries that focus on the question
- Better error handling with more helpful error messages
- Graceful degradation when API calls fail

## Implementation Details

### Step Chaining
```javascript
// Build context based on previous steps' results
if (i > 0) {
  cumulativeContext = stepResults.map((result, idx) => {
    const prevStep = executionPlan.value[idx];
    return `Step ${idx + 1}: ${prevStep.title}\n${result}`;
  }).join('\n\n');
}

// Include cumulative context in the prompt
const stepPrompt = `
  ...
  ${i > 0 ? `Previous steps' results:\n\n${cumulativeContext}` : ''}
  ...
  Build upon the previous steps' results if available.
  Do not repeat information that has already been covered in previous steps.
`;
```

### Summary Cleaning
```javascript
// Helper function to clean the final summary of any meta-commentary
const cleanFinalSummary = (summary) => {
  if (!summary) return '';
  
  // Remove common meta-commentary phrases
  let cleaned = summary;
  
  // Check if summary starts with any meta phrase
  for (const phrase of metaPhrases) {
    if (cleaned.toLowerCase().startsWith(phrase.toLowerCase())) {
      // Find the end of the phrase and remove it
      const match = cleaned.match(new RegExp(`^${phrase}[,:.;]?\\s*`, 'i'));
      if (match) {
        cleaned = cleaned.substring(match[0].length);
        // Capitalize the first letter of the new summary
        cleaned = cleaned.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + cleaned.slice(1);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Similar processing for conclusion phrases
  
  return cleaned;
};
```

## User Experience Benefits

1. **More Direct Answers**: Users receive answers that directly address their questions without workflow commentary
2. **Higher Quality Responses**: Each step building on previous steps leads to more comprehensive and coherent answers
3. **Maintained Transparency**: The workflow visualization still shows the step-by-step process for transparency
4. **Cleaner Chat Interface**: Final messages in the chat are focused solely on answering the question

## Future Considerations

1. Further refinement of prompts for specific question types
2. More sophisticated context management for very complex multi-step workflows
3. Potential for user feedback on specific steps during the workflow
4. Performance optimizations for faster response times
