# Streaming Messages Fix Documentation

## Issue
Messages from Claude 3.7 streaming API were showing up empty in the chat interface.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the code flow from client to server and back, I identified that the issue is related to Vue's reactivity system. When updating the message content during streaming, Vue was not detecting the changes properly because we were directly modifying a property of a reactive object.

## Fix Implementation
1. Modified the content update logic in `ChatContainer.vue` to properly trigger Vue's reactivity:
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   const newContent = assistantMessage.content + content;
   assistantMessage.content = newContent;
   
   // After:
   const index = messages.value.findIndex(msg => msg.id === assistantMessage.id);
   if (index !== -1) {
     const updatedMessage = { ...messages.value[index] };
     updatedMessage.content = (updatedMessage.content || '') + content;
     messages.value.splice(index, 1, updatedMessage);
   } else {
     // Fallback to direct modification if message not found
     assistantMessage.content = (assistantMessage.content || '') + content;
   }
   ```

2. Added additional logging to both server and client sides to better diagnose streaming issues in the future:
   - More detailed logging of content chunks in the server API
   - Better logging of content chunks in the client-side processing

## Technical Explanation
In Vue's reactivity system, directly modifying a property of a nested object doesn't always trigger reactivity updates. The proper way to update an object in an array is to:

1. Find the object in the array
2. Create a new object with the updated properties
3. Replace the old object with the new one using `splice()`

This ensures that Vue detects the change and updates the UI accordingly.

## Testing
The fix has been tested by sending multiple messages and verifying that streaming content appears correctly in the chat interface.

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using Vue's `toRef` or `computed` properties for better reactivity handling
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for streaming responses
3. Implement a retry mechanism for failed streaming requests
