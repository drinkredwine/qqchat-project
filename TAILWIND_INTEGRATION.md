## Tailwind CSS Integration Status

After investigating the project, I've found that Tailwind CSS is already properly integrated:

### Current Setup
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`: ^6.13.2
  - `tailwindcss`: ^3.4.17
  - `postcss`: ^8.5.3
  - `autoprefixer`: ^10.4.21

- **Configuration**:
  - `nuxt.config.ts` includes the Tailwind module
  - `tailwind.config.js` is properly configured
  - Components are already using Tailwind classes

### Verification
- The project successfully runs with Tailwind CSS enabled
- The UI components are styled with Tailwind utility classes

### Next Steps
No further action is needed for basic Tailwind CSS integration as it's already working correctly. 

Potential enhancements could include:
- Adding custom theme extensions
- Setting up additional Tailwind plugins
- Creating more reusable components with Tailwind styling

### Example Usage
The project already demonstrates Tailwind CSS usage in:
- `app.vue` - Main application layout with Tailwind classes
- `components/TailwindCard.vue` - A component showcasing Tailwind styling
