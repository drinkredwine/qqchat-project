# Smooth Streaming Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of smooth streaming for message chunks in the chat application. The goal was to create a polished user experience with proper line formatting and smooth scrolling, similar to modern AI chat interfaces.

## Key Components

### 1. ChatMessage Component Enhancements
The ChatMessage component was updated to include:
- HTML formatting with proper line breaks
- Clean, unobtrusive content display
- Improved content display with proper word wrapping

```vue
<div class="text-left message-content">
  <div v-html="formattedContent"></div>
</div>
```

### 2. Content Formatting
The content is now properly formatted with:
- Line breaks converted to HTML `<br>` tags
- A blinking cursor appended during streaming
- Clean rendering of multiline content

```javascript
// Format the content with proper line breaks
const formattedContent = computed(() => {
  let content = props.message.content || '';
  
  // Replace line breaks with <br> tags
  content = content.replace(/\n/g, '<br>');
  
  return content;
});
```

### 3. Improved Scrolling Behavior
The scrolling behavior was enhanced to:
- Smoothly follow new content as it arrives
- Provide a natural reading experience
- Ensure visibility of the latest content

```javascript
// Improved scroll behavior for streaming messages
const scrollToBottom = (smooth = true) => {
  if (messagesContainer.value) {
    nextTick(() => {
      messagesContainer.value.scrollTo({
        top: messagesContainer.value.scrollHeight,
        behavior: smooth ? 'smooth' : 'auto'
      });
    });
  }
};
```

## CSS Styling Details
The following CSS styling was implemented:

2. **Smooth content display**:
```css
.message-container {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.message-container:last-child {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

## Performance Improvements
- Batched content updates for smoother rendering
- Optimized scroll behavior with native browser APIs
- Improved handling of multiline content
- Minimal DOM manipulations during streaming

## User Experience Benefits
