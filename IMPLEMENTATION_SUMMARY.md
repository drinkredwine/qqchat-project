# Implementation Summary: Fix Streaming Chat Response

## Problem
In the current implementation, when a user sends a message in the chat interface, there is a delay before any response appears. The streaming response from the assistant is not shown immediately, which can make the interface feel unresponsive.

## Solution
The solution is to modify the `sendMessage` function in `ChatContainer.vue` to:

1. Immediately add an empty assistant message with a typing indicator after the user sends their message
2. Use Vue's `nextTick()` to ensure the UI updates with this empty message before making the API call
3. Keep the typing indicator visible while the streaming response is being received
4. Gradually fill the empty message with the streaming response as it comes in

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes:
- Added the assistant's empty message immediately after the user's message
- Added `await nextTick()` to ensure the UI updates before making the API call
- Maintained the typing indicator until the streaming response is complete

### Code Changes:
```javascript
// Function to send a new message
const sendMessage = async () => {
  if (!messageText.value.trim()) return;
  
  // Create and add the user message
  const newMessage = {
    id: messages.value.length + 1,
    content: messageText.value,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    senderId: currentUser.value.id,
    status: 'sent'
  };
  
  // Add the user message
  messages.value.push(newMessage);
  messageText.value = '';
  
  // Reset textarea height
  if (textareaRef.value) {
    textareaRef.value.style.height = 'auto';
  }
  
  // Immediately create and add a placeholder for the assistant's response
  const assistantMessage = {
    id: messages.value.length + 1,
    content: '',
    timestamp: new Date(),
    senderId: activeChat.value.id,
    status: 'typing',
    isStreaming: true
  };
  
  // Add the placeholder message immediately
  messages.value.push(assistantMessage);
  
  // Ensure the UI updates before making the API call
  await nextTick();
  
  // ... rest of the function remains the same
};
```

## Benefits
- Improved user experience by providing immediate feedback
- Clearer indication that the message is being processed
- More natural conversation flow similar to modern chat applications
- Better handling of the streaming response

## Testing
The implementation was tested by:
1. Sending messages in the chat interface
2. Verifying that an empty message with a typing indicator appears immediately
3. Confirming that the empty message is gradually filled with the streaming response
